 Try asking: 'who is the largest shareholder for ZA Bank?'
=======================================================

You: Hey FinTalk, for companies in the '1000+ staffs' size category whose tech summary mentions 'digital banking', could you calculate their management to employee ratio? Also, list the names of their CEOs and their largest shareholder's name and stake.

New user query received. It's complex and conversational. As per my core instructions, my first action is **always** to classify the user's primary intent to understand the overall goal. I will call the CLS worker.

The intent is a `COMPOUND_REQUEST`, confirming the complexity. The query is long and contains noise. Before I formulate a detailed plan, I need to extract the clean, core entities. I will call the KE worker to parse the query into a structured format. This will help me build a robust plan.

Excellent, the KE worker has provided a clean, structured request. I now have all the components to build a concrete plan.
**High-Level Plan:**
1.  Identify all companies that match the filter criteria ('1000+ staffs' AND 'digital banking' in summary).
2.  For each identified company:
    a. Get the total number of managers.
    b. Get the total employee size.
    c. Calculate the 'management_to_employee_ratio' using the formula tool.
    d. Find the name of the CEO.
    e. Find the largest shareholder's name and percentage.
3.  Synthesize all this information into a final answer.
**My immediate next step is Step 1.** I need to get the list of company IDs that fit the criteria. I will ask the NL2SQL worker to generate the query for this.
